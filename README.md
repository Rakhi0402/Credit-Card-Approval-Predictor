# Credit-Card-Approval-Predictor
The Credit Card Approval Predictor is a machine learning project that automates the assessment of credit card applications. Using historical applicant data, the model evaluates factors such as income, employment status, credit history, and debt-to-income ratio to predict whether an applicant's credit card request will be approved or rejected.

The project leverages logistic regression, stochastic gradient descent (SGD), and hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy. The dataset is preprocessed with missing value imputation and feature engineering techniques to enhance prediction performance. The model's effectiveness is measured using accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports over multiple training epochs.

This predictive system helps financial institutions streamline approvals, reduce manual effort, and minimize financial risk. ðŸš€
